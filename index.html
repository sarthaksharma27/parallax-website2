        <h2>Moon Light</h2>
        <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its diameter is about one-quarter of Earth's (comparable to the width of Australia),[17] making it the fifth largest
            satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet. It is larger than all known dwarf planets in the Solar System.[18]
            The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any
            significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g‚ÄîJupiter's moon Io is the only satellite
            in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times
             Earth's diameter. Its gravitational influence is the main driver of Earth's tides and very slowly lengthens Earth's day. The Moon's orbit around Earth has a
            sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of the Moon's Earth-facing surface that is illuminated by the Sun varies
            from none up to nearly 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar.[19] The Moon is tidally locked to Earth,
            which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat
            longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period. Due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), 59% of the lunar surface is visible from Earth.
            The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from
            a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. It receded to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth. 
            The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent
            impact craters. Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago.
            Although the reflectance of the lunar surface is low (comparable to that of asphalt), its large angular diameter makes the full moon the brightest
            celestial object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely
            during a total solar eclipse.

            The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply Moon, with a capital M.[20][21] The noun moon is derived from Old English m≈çna, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic *mƒìn≈çn,[22] which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *mƒìnsis "month"[23] (from earlier *mƒìn≈çt, genitive *mƒìneses) which may be related to the verb "measure" (of time).[24]

            Occasionally, the name Luna /ÀàluÀên…ô/ is used in scientific writing[25] and especially in science fiction to distinguish the Earth's moon from others, while in poetry "Luna" has been used to denote personification of the Moon.[26] Cynthia /Ààs…™nŒ∏i…ô/ is another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon personified as a goddess,[27] while Selene /s…ôÀàliÀêniÀê/ (literally "Moon") is the Greek goddess of the Moon.

            The usual English adjective pertaining to the Moon is "lunar", derived from the Latin word for the Moon, l≈´na. The adjective selenian /s…ôliÀêni…ôn/,[28] derived from the Greek word for the Moon, œÉŒµŒªŒÆŒΩŒ∑ selƒìnƒì, and used to describe the Moon as a world rather than as an object in the sky, is rare,[29] while its cognate selenic was originally a rare synonym[30] but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium.[31] The Greek word for the Moon does however provide us with the prefix seleno-, as in selenography, the study of the physical features of the Moon, as well as the element name selenium.[32][33]

            The Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, Artemis, equated with the Roman Diana, one of whose symbols was the Moon and who was often regarded as the goddess of the Moon, was also called Cynthia, from her legendary birthplace on Mount Cynthus.[34] These names ‚Äì Luna, Cynthia and Selene ‚Äì are reflected in technical terms for lunar orbits such as apolune, pericynthion and selenocentric.

            The astronomical symbol for the Moon is a crescent, ‚òæ, for example in M‚òæ 'lunar mass' (also ML).
            <br><br>
            Isotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System.[37][38] Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed,[39] but none satisfactorily explains the features of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system. A fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force[40] would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth.[41] Gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon[42] depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon.[41] A co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon.[41] None of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system.[43]

            The prevailing theory is that the Earth‚ÄìMoon system formed after a giant impact of a Mars-sized body (named Theia) with the proto-Earth. The impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and the material accreted and formed the Moon[44][45] just beyond the Earth's Roche limit of ~2.56 Rüú®.[46]

            Giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system. These simulations show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth.[47] However, more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the proto-Earth.[48][49][50][51] Other bodies of the inner Solar System such as Mars and Vesta have, according to meteorites from them, very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to Earth. However, Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two,[52] although this is debated.[53]
